        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Eunhye (Grace) Youn, and I am a psychology major at University of California, Riverside. I have always been fascinated by the human mind, and I am excited to pursue a career in psychology. I have always been interested in the human mind. As a child, I would often ask my parents questions about why people do the things they do. I was fascinated by the idea that our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors could be influenced by our environment, our genetics, and our experiences. My interest in psychology only grew stronger as I got older. In high school, I took AP Psychology and was blown away by the material. I learned about the different theories of psychology, the different types of mental disorders, and the different ways that psychologists can help people.<br><br>

        I have had the opportunity to gain valuable professional experience in the field of psychology through my coursework, internships, and volunteer work. In my coursework, I have taken classes on a variety of topics, including abnormal psychology, cognitive psychology, and social psychology. These classes have given me a strong foundation in the field of psychology and have prepared me for my future career. I have also had the opportunity to gain professional experience through my internships and volunteer work. I interned at a local mental health clinic, where I worked with clients who were struggling with a variety of mental health issues. I also volunteered at a crisis hotline, where I provided support to people who were in crisis. These experiences have given me a firsthand look at the challenges and rewards of working in the field of psychology. In addition to my academic and professional experience, I am also involved in a number of extracurricular activities. I am a member of the Psychology Club and the Student Government Association. I am also a volunteer tutor at the local library. These activities have helped me to develop my leadership, teamwork, and communication skills.
<br><br>

        I am excited to continue my education and training in psychology. I plan to pursue a master's degree in clinical psychology after I graduate from college. I am passionate about helping people, and I believe that a career in psychology will allow me to make a positive impact on the lives of others. I am confident that my skills and experience will make me a valuable asset to any organization. I am a hard worker, I am dedicated to my studies, and I am passionate about helping others. I am excited to start my career in psychology and to make a difference in the world.
